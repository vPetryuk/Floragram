This herbaceous perennial plant is popularly called \"dancing pupae\". This genus unites many species, most of which are represented by epiphytes. However, there are also terrestrial plants and lithophytes. Under natural conditions, such a flower is most often found in the Antilles, in Central and South America, and also in the southern part of Florida.\r\n\r\nOncidium prefers to grow in various types of forests, while it is found at an altitude of up to 4 thousand meters above sea level. The first description of such an orchid was made by the botanist from Sweden Peter Olof Swartz, this happened in 1800.\r\n\r\nIn domestic culture, natural species are quite widespread, as well as their hybrids and varieties.\r\n\r\nFeatures of oncidium\r\n\r\nOncidium is an orchid that has a sympodial branching type. Some species reach a height of only 10 to 15 centimeters, and outwardly they are similar to irises. There are also large species, the rhizome of which can be long or short, pseudobulbs are distinctly expressed, and their lanceolate leaf plates can be folded in half in length.\r\n\r\nHeat-loving species are characterized by leathery to the touch and tough foliage, while in shade-tolerant ones it is thinner and softer. During flowering, clusters of fragrant flowers are formed, which can be drooping, strongly branched, straight and arcuate curved. Flowers in diameter can reach 1-12 centimeters, while the length of the inflorescence can vary from 10 to 500 centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe color of the flowers is varied, but the predominant shades are brownish red and yellow. The petals and sepals do not differ much in appearance, but the lateral sepals can grow together into one. At the base of the flower lip, which has a guitar-like shape, there is a comb or tuberous growth. Cut inflorescences can last up to 20 days. Flowering can begin at any time of the year. Disclosure of flowers on\r\nBlooming oncidium\r\nFlowering care\r\nIf the home oncidium develops within the normal range, then its flowering will be observed at a frequency of 1 time in 9-12 months. However, if the bush has a large number of pseudobulbs, then flowering can be observed more often. The orchid blooms for 28–35 days. Most hybrids bloom 2 or 3 times within 1 year. Please note that if the air temperature is above 18 degrees at night, then the flower arrow will form more slowly. To stimulate the growth of the peduncle, they resort to abundant watering and regular foliar and root dressing.\r\n\r\nPost-flowering care\r\n\r\nThose hybrid varieties that do not have pseudobulbs have a more pronounced dormant period compared to hybrids with pseudobulbs. The beginning of the dormant period falls just at the time when the young shoots are fully ripe. While the plant is at rest, it is watered once every 2-3 weeks, do not feed it and put it in a cooler place.\r\n\r\nIf the variety has pseudobulbs, then the dormant period will be unexpressed, in this regard, the growing conditions do not need to be changed.\r\n\r\nReproduction of oncidium\r\n\r\nIndoor orchid oncidium is propagated only by dividing the bush. For division, choose a bush that has at least six pseudobulbs. Remove the flower from the container and remove all the substrate from its root system. Take a very sharp instrument, sterilize it and divide the plant with it so that at least 3 pseudobulbs are present on each division. After the places of the cuts are sprinkled with coal powder, the cuttings are planted in separate pots.\r\n\r\nDo not water a divided orchid for at least 7 days. As a rule, the procedure for dividing a bush is combined with a transplant. Please note that the substrate must be completely dry when dividing the orchid.\r\n\r\nDiseases and pests\r\nPests and the fight against them\r\n\r\n\r\nMost often, pests such as mealybugs settle on an indoor oncidium. scale insects, spider mites and thrips. To get rid of them, treat the bush with a solution of Karbofos or Actellik (20 drops per 1 liter of water). However, before you start spraying the plant, the scale insects and scale insects must be removed from it manually. To do this, use a cotton swab, which is moistened in vodka, alcohol or soapy water.\r\n\r\nYou can get rid of pests with the help of folk remedies, for example, onion or garlic infusion.

It is recommended to put on a window of west or east orientation. If flower stalks appear on the bush in winter, then supplementary lighting should be organized for it using artificial light sources.\r\nTemperature conditions. It directly depends on the species: in winter - 7-18 degrees, and in summer - 20-30 degrees. Most hybrids sold in flower shops can grow and bloom within normal limits at temperatures of 14-26 degrees. But at the same time, it is imperative that the daytime temperature differs from the nighttime by 3 or 4 degrees.\r\nWatering. At the very beginning of the growing season, water should be abundantly and systematically by immersion in water. Almost complete cessation of watering is carried out from the moment the pseudobulb begins to form. Only after the flower arrow appears, do they begin to gradually resume and increase watering. When the bush fades, water it sparingly or sparingly.\r\nAir humidity. Its level can vary from 40 to 70 percent. On hot days, as well as in winter, when heating devices are actively working, the bush must be moistened from a spray bottle with warm water, and it is also recommended to put a container with a flower on a deep tray filled with wet expanded clay. After the room is colder than 18 degrees at night, the humidification from the spray bottle is stopped.\r\nFertilizer. Oncidium needs feeding from the beginning of the growing season to the beginning of the formation of young shoots. After that, top dressing is carried out from the moment the peduncle is formed until the beginning of flowering. If desired, fertilizers can be applied alternately at the root and on the leaf. Experts advise feeding the flower, combining the procedure with every second watering.\r\nRest period. In hybrids that do not form a pseudobulb, the dormant period begins after the young shoots mature. During this period, the bush is watered sparsely, it is not fed, and is also rearranged to a cooler place. This contributes to the full restoration of the flower.

As a result of the vaccinations carried out by specialists, a large number of completely new species of cacti were born, which have a very spectacular and extremely beautiful appearance.\r\n\r\nIllumination\r\nThis plant is very fond of light, which should be in sufficient quantities even in summer, even in winter. It is recommended to place the cereus on a southeast or south orientation window.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that such plants adore direct rays of the sun, burns may appear on their surface in spring and summer. In order to prevent this, it is necessary at the end of the winter period to accustom the cereus to direct sunlight gradually.\r\n\r\nTemperature regime\r\n\r\n\r\nIn winter, the recommended temperature for this plant is between 8-12 degrees. In the spring-summer period, the plant is not afraid of heat and sudden changes in temperature. It is recommended to move the cactus to fresh air (balcony or open veranda) in the summer and keep it there until the beginning of the autumn period.\r\n\r\nHow to water\r\nDo not water the plant with too hard or cold water. In the spring-summer period, watering should be moderate, but with the onset of autumn, it should be gradually reduced. In winter, watering the cactus should be extremely sparse. Cereus reacts negatively to waterlogging, as a result of which it can weaken and get sick.\r\n\r\nHumidity\r\nIn the spring and summer, it is recommended to moisten the plant with a sprayer with clean, lukewarm water.\r\n\r\nFertilizer\r\n\r\n\r\nCereus is a fast-growing plant that needs regular feeding for normal growth and development. It is recommended to feed from mid-spring to mid-summer.

In nature, they can be found in the southwest of North America, as well as in the arid and desert regions of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese plants, depending on the species, can have a very different shape. So, they can have a spherical or flattened shape, as well as elongated in a column. The stems are both single and covered with a large number of children. In height, they can reach both several tens of centimeters and four meters. There are species capable of forming quite extensive colonies. They can reach several meters in diameter and combine several hundred shoots.\r\n\r\nMost often, there are straight, thick ribs, which are also deeply cut. Areoles are rather large, pubescent, but on the top of the cactus there is no “cap” consisting of them.

In this regard, it is recommended to put it on the sill of a south-facing window. In summer, it is recommended to move to fresh air (to the balcony or to the garden).\r\n\r\nIf there is little light, then the needles become smaller and paler, while some part flies around.\r\n\r\nTemperature regime\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plant is very fond of warmth and in the summer it needs a temperature of 20 to 35 degrees. In winter, it should be placed in a fairly cool place (10 to 15 degrees). It should be borne in mind that if the room is colder than 10 degrees, then this can cause frostbite of the plant, as well as its death.\r\n\r\nFerocactus needs fresh air and therefore it is necessary to ventilate the room regularly, but this should be done with extreme caution, because it reacts extremely negatively to drafts.\r\n\r\nHow to water\r\nWatering should be sparse. So, it is produced only after the substrate is completely dry in the pot. Water the plant with water at room temperature, which should settle well.\r\n\r\nFrom November to March, the plant can not be watered at all, but this is only if the room is quite cool. If the cactus hibernates in the warmth, then watering should be carried out according to the same scheme as in the summer.\r\n\r\nHumidity\r\n\r\n\r\nIt grows well at low air humidity, which is most often present in urban apartments. You do not need to moisturize it, but you can carry out regular warm showers to remove accumulated dirt. For more effective cleaning, you can use a small paint brush or a soft toothbrush.\r\n\r\nEarth mixture\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the wild, this species of cactus prefers to grow on rocky or limestone soil. Under indoor conditions, for normal growth and development, a similar soil will be needed, which should be porous, drained and sufficiently acidic (pH 7 or 8). To create a soil mixture at home, you will need to combine sod and leafy soil, fine gravel (can be replaced with brick chips) and coarse sand, which should be taken in equal proportions. To avoid the formation of rot on the root system, it is recommended to pour a small amount of charcoal into the ground.\r\n\r\nYou can use a commercially available dredge intended for cacti, but it is imperative to add fine gravel or coarse sand to it.\r\n\r\nBe sure to drain well to prevent stagnation of fluid in the ground.\r\n\r\nFertilizers\r\nFerocactus grows in nature on poor soils, in this regard, you should be very careful during feeding.

The fact is that such a plant is undemanding to growing conditions, has a rather spectacular appearance and has medicinal properties. It is quite simple to care for Gruzoni's echinocactus grown indoors, but you still need to know a few important rules, which will be discussed in more detail below.\r\n\r\nFeatures of echinocactus\r\nEchinocactus\r\n\r\nEchinocactus is part of the Cactaceae family. Under natural conditions, it can be found in the southwestern United States and in the desert areas of Mexico. There are many types of this plant, but the most popular among flower growers is the echinocactus Gruzoni, which is also the most common species in nature. This perennial is notable for its slow growth, and the locals call it “hedgehog cactus”. The fact is that the needles and the shape of this plant are very similar to this animal. This type of echinocactus was named after the German cactus collector and inventor Hermann Gruzoni.\r\n\r\nIn natural conditions, such a cactus can reach very large sizes. Moreover, Gruzoni's echinocactus in nature can be gigantic: in width it can grow up to about 100 centimeters, and in height - up to 150 centimeters. It is a long-lived plant that can grow for an average of 200 to 500 years. While the bush is young, it has a spherical shape, which over the years is replaced by a barrel-shaped one. That is why such a plant is also called the \"golden barrel\". Over the years, the appearance of such a cactus has undergone significant changes. When the bush turns 3 or 4 years old, its small tubercles turn into sharp ribs that cover sharp and strong thorns. The upper part of the bush gradually grows, and at first it is covered with \"down\", which is actually not hardened thorns.\r\n\r\nEchinocactus grusonii\r\n\r\nThe stem of Echinocactus Gruzoni has the shape of a ball, and its surface is covered with vertically located sharp ribs, and there can be 35–45 of them. The shiny stem is green. The needles grow in bundles from the areoles, which are located on the ribs of the plant. Each of the areoles grows 1–4 central spines and about 10 radial needles. Their length can vary from 30 to 50 mm, and the radial needles are shorter than the central ones. The growing upper part is decorated with a spectacular \"cap\" consisting of young spines that look like a downy. The needles can be painted in various shades from pale yellow to white. Please note that Guzoni's echinocactus with green, red or rich yellow needles do not exist. These cacti are grown specially for sale using dyes. After some time, they acquire their natural color. However, if harmful paints were used to grow such a bush, then it can get sick and die.\r\n\r\nUnder indoor conditions, such a plant can reach 0.4 m in diameter, and from 0.4 to 0.6 m in height.However, a cactus will only be able to reach this size after several decades. Echinocactus blooms very effectively, but the first flowers appear on it only after it turns 20 years old. Flowering is observed in May – June. First, in the upper part of the bush, a bud is formed on a long stem, and a yellow flower opens from it. There is pubescence on the outer surface of the funnel-shaped tube. Glossy petals are rather thin, closer to the edge their color becomes darker with a brownish tint. The corolla in diameter reaches about 50 mm, and its length is up to 70 mm.", "Family": "", "Tribe": "", "Genus": "", "video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Pz1a51mSc", "growing_conditions": "Below we will talk about how to care for Gruzoni's indoor echinocactus. In order for this plant to be as effective as possible, you will need to follow the simplest rules for growing it.\r\n\r\nIllumination\r\nSince the homeland of such a plant is the desert area of ​​Mexico, it is considered photophilous. In indoor conditions, he needs a lot of bright light. In this regard, it is recommended to choose a south-facing window for such a cactus. Even the direct rays of the sun are not afraid of him. In summer, the bush can be taken out into the garden, on the balcony, or in direct sunlight. In order for the stem not to bend, it must be regularly rotated relative to the light source. If the lighting is too scarce, then the needles will begin to crumble, and new ones will grow very thin. In the cold season, such a plant must be provided with additional artificial lighting. Experts recommend using phytolamps rather than simple bulbs for this.\r\n\r\nTemperature regime\r\nEchinocactus grows best at a temperature of about 25 degrees. If the room is very hot (above 30 degrees), then the bush has a suspension of growth. In winter, this cactus has a dormant period, during which it should be cool about (12 degrees). However, make sure that the room where the plant is located is not colder than 10 degrees. Because of this, the cactus can freeze, as a result of which specks of brownish color appear on the surface of its stem. This can lead to the death of the cactus.\r\n\r\nWatering\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequency and abundance of watering is influenced by the air temperature in the room and the season. In the spring-summer period, the soil mixture in the pot is moistened only after it is completely dry. To do this, use well-settled water, the temperature of which should be close to room temperature. If in winter the bush is in a cool place, then it is not necessary to water it at all. However, if it hibernates in a warm place, then watering is carried out 1 time in 30 days, using warm water for this.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to moisten the echinocactus from the sprayer. In order to remove dust from its surface, in the summertime it is arranged with a warm shower; for convenience, you can use a clean paint brush. Remember that if the cactus is watered very abundantly or often, then rot may appear on its root system.\r\n\r\nSubstrate\r\nThis plant, like all other cacti, grows well and develops only in a substrate that is neutral and breathable well. If desired, ready-made soil mixture for cacti can be bought in a specialized store, and it is imperative to add a small amount of brick chips or fine gravel to it. In order to prevent the appearance of rot on the root system, crushed charcoal is added to the soil mixture. If you have the opportunity, then prepare the soil mixture with your own hands. It is very simple to do this, for this you just need to combine fine gravel (crushed brick), coarse river sand, leaf and sod soil (1: 2: 2: 4). A little charcoal is poured into the finished soil mixture, which is crushed in advance.\r\n\r\nSuitable pot\r\nSuitable pot\r\n\r\nIn order for Echinocactus Gruzoni to grow normally, he should choose a suitable flower pot. In diameter, the container should be slightly larger than the diameter of the stem. Also, it should not be very high and quite stable. The root system of Echinocactus is superficial, and it is not very developed. Containers made of plastic are best suited for this plant; ceramic pots can also be used, but their surface should be covered with glaze. If the ceramic pot is unglazed, then moisture will evaporate through the walls, which causes the root system to cool. Remember that echinocactus react extremely negatively to hypothermia of the roots.\r\n\r\nIt is by the size of the root system that the height of the planting tank is determined. Remember to add 20 millimeters to the height of the pot, which you will need to add to the root collar of the plant.

Na wolności taką roślinę można znaleźć w Iranie, Afryce, tropikalnych rejonach kontynentu amerykańskiego, na Kaukazie, w Chinach, Indiach, południowej Azji i Azji Środkowej. Istnieje opinia, że ​​miejscem narodzin bazyliki jest Afryka, a na terytorium Europy dostała się ona dzięki żołnierzom armii A. Macedończyka. Wcześniej taka kultura była zwykle używana jako roślina lecznicza. Dziś jest uprawiana w prawie wszystkich krajach jako przyprawa spożywcza.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunkcje bazylii\r\nBazylia\r\n\r\nBazylia ma rozgałęziony i powierzchowny system korzeniowy. Prosta czworościenna łodyga osiąga 0,5–0,7 m wysokości, jest ulistniona i rozgałęziona. Rzadko uzębione, podłużno-jajowate blaszki liściowe są krótkoszypułkowe. Na powierzchni liści i pędów występują kosmki. Nieregularne okółki składają się z białych, różowawych lub fioletowych kwiatów pod pachami. Owoce zawierają orzechy, które po pełnym dojrzewaniu łatwo się od siebie oddzielają. Nasiona zachowują żywotność przez 5 lat.\r\n\r\nNajsilniejszy zapach mają fioletowe odmiany tej rośliny, bardzo popularne na Kaukazie iw Azji. Zielona bazylia jest najbardziej pożądana w Europie, a roślina ta jest również uważana za najpopularniejszą przyprawę w kuchni śródziemnomorskiej. Zanim krzew zacznie kwitnąć, zaczyna wydzielać najostrzejszy zapach.\r\n\r\nO której zasiać\r\nBazylię można uprawiać przez sadzonki lub wysiewać bezpośrednio na otwartym terenie. Jednak większość ogrodników wybiera pierwszą metodę, ponieważ jest ona najbardziej niezawodna.\r\n\r\nSiew nasion do sadzonek odbywa się wiosną, zaleca się to od początku do połowy kwietnia. Do siewu potrzebujesz specjalnej mieszanki gleby. Aby go przygotować, konieczne jest połączenie humusu, zgniłego kompostu i umytego piasku rzecznego, które należy przyjmować w stosunku 2: 4: 1. Podłoże to musi być przesiane, a następnie poddane parowaniu w łaźni wodnej przez 60 minut. Jeśli użyjesz gotowej mieszanki gleby do siewu, która jest sprzedawana w sklepie, to również będzie musiała zostać zdezynfekowana. Aby to zrobić, rozlej go silnym roztworem manganu potasu lub Fitosporin. Do siewu bazylii możesz wybrać skrzynki, ale w tym przypadku musisz być przygotowany na to, że rośliny będą potrzebować kilofów według poszczególnych pojemników. Dlatego eksperci zalecają stosowanie kaset do uprawy takich sadzonek, których głębokość powinna wynosić 50–70 mm.\r\n\r\nWysiew nasion odbywa się na wilgotnym podłożu, zakopując je tylko na 10 mm. Rozstaw rzędów podczas siewu we wspólnej skrzyni powinien wynosić około 50 centymetrów. Uprawy z góry należy przykryć polietylenem lub szkłem, po czym przenieść do dobrze oświetlonego i ciepłego (od 20 do 25 stopni) miejsca. Pierwsze sadzonki można zobaczyć 7-15 dni po siewie.", "Family": "Magnoliopsida", "Tribe": "jasnotowce", "Genus": "bazylia", "video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvADaEdkm_8", "growing_conditions": "Jak podlewać\r\nRosnąca bazylia na parapecie\r\n\r\nBazylia to roślina kochająca wilgoć. W związku z tym należy upewnić się, że podłoże jest przez cały czas lekko wilgotne. Podlewanie powinno odbywać się prawie codziennie. Jeśli zapomnisz podlać krzew na czas, jego liście bardzo szybko stracą turgor. Ale przy podlewaniu bardzo ważne jest również, aby nie przesadzać, ponieważ z powodu zastoju płynu w podłożu na systemie korzeniowym może pojawić się zgnilizna. Po podlaniu rośliny konieczne jest rozluźnienie powierzchni podłoża w pojemniku, rób to z częstotliwością 1 raz na 2-3 dni.\r\n\r\n\r\nNawóz\r\nJeśli do posadzenia tej rośliny użyto mało żyznego podłoża, to w takim przypadku należy ją systematycznie karmić. Do żywienia zaleca się stosowanie nawozów uniwersalnych na bazie kompostu lub humatów, należy je dodać do podłoża w stężeniu wskazanym w instrukcji dołączonej do preparatu. Musisz karmić krzak nie więcej niż 1 raz w ciągu 4 tygodni.\r\n\r\n\r\nLądowanie na otwartym terenie\r\nJak wspomniano powyżej, konieczne jest sadzenie sadzonek bazylii w otwartym terenie od połowy do końca maja, ale należy upewnić się, że pozostały wiosenne przymrozki. Do lądowania należy wybrać otwarty, dobrze oświetlony obszar, który musi być niezawodnie chroniony przed zimnymi, silnymi wiatrami. Niektórym ogrodnikom zaleca się sadzenie bazylii w kręgu młodego drzewa owocowego, praktycznie nie ma z niego cienia, więc roślina otrzymuje wystarczającą ilość światła, a jej silny pikantny aromat może odstraszyć różne szkodniki od sadzonki .\r\n\r\nGleba na stanowisku powinna być lekka i nasycona próchnicą, a także powinna dobrze przepuszczać wodę. Na 4 tygodnie przed sadzeniem miejsce należy przekopać, a do gleby dodać torf, humus lub kompost (na 1 metr kwadratowy stanowiska 2 kg nawozu organicznego).\r\n\r\nWyokrętowanie powinno nastąpić wieczorem lub w pochmurny dzień. Przygotuj otwory, odległość między nimi powinna wynosić od 15 do 20 centymetrów. Należy w nich posadzić wyrośnięte sadzonki. Posadzone rośliny potrzebują obfitego podlewania, do tego używają letniej, dobrze osiadłej wody.\r\n\r\n\r\nUprawa bazylii na otwartej glebie jest dość łatwa. Aby to zrobić, należy go w odpowiednim czasie podlewać, odchwaszczać, karmić, poluzowywać i chronić przed szkodnikami i chorobami. Posadzone rośliny, które nie zdążyły się zakorzenić, należy przykryć folią przez pierwsze 15 dni w nocy w przypadku nagłego przeziębienia. Dopóki roślina nie wzmocni się i nie zacznie rosnąć, zaleca się systematyczne odchwaszczanie. W sezonie przed podlaniem konieczne będzie spulchnienie gleby 7 lub 8 razy. Aby stymulować rozgałęzienie, konieczne jest ostrożne wyrwanie nowo pojawiających się szypułek kwiatowych.\r\n\r\nJak podlewać\r\n\r\nCzęste podlewanie bazylii spowoduje znacznie intensywniejszy wzrost nowych blaszek liściowych. Podlewanie należy wykonać natychmiast po wyschnięciu wierzchniej warstwy gleby. Należy jednak pamiętać, że nadmierne podlewanie jest tak samo niedopuszczalne, jak niewystarczające, ponieważ powoduje poważne uszkodzenia rośliny. Należy ją podlewać letnią wodą (ok. 25 stopni), natomiast powinna osiadać przez 24 godziny (tak długo, jak to możliwe). Aby wygodniej było przygotować wodę do nawadniania, konieczne jest zainstalowanie dużego pojemnika na miejscu w dobrze oświetlonym miejscu, na przykład niepotrzebnej wanny lub beczki.\r\n\r\nNawóz\r\nAby stymulować wzrost zielonej masy bazylii, będziesz potrzebować regularnego karmienia, które odbywa się 1 raz na 4 tygodnie. Pierwsze karmienie odbywa się pół miesiąca po posadzeniu sadzonek na miejscu, w tym celu używają roztworu Nitrofoski (kilka dużych łyżek nawozu na 12 litrów wody). Na 1 metr kwadratowy ziemi powinno przypadać od 3 do 4 litrów mieszanki składników odżywczych.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo możesz posadzić po bazylii\r\nEksperci odradzają sadzenie co roku bazylii na tym samym obszarze. Konieczna jest zmiana upraw, co jest główną zasadą udanego rolnictwa. Jeśli bazylia była uprawiana na tej samej działce przez 2 lub 3 sezony z rzędu, to dopiero po 4 lub 5 latach będzie można ją posadzić w tym samym miejscu. Obszar, na którym wcześniej uprawiano bazylię, nadaje się do sadzenia roślin odpornych na choroby tej kultury, np. można sadzić marchew, cukinię, dynie, pomidory, rośliny strączkowe, ogórki, kabaczki i wczesne ziemniaki. Bazylię zaleca się sadzić po pomidorach, kapuście wczesnej i kalafiorowej, truskawkach, syderatach, cebuli, burakach i ziołach.", "category": "Garden and vegetables", "subcategory": "Spicy herbs and greens"}}]
